# Python-project
# Music Player Application

This Python script is a simple music player application built using the Tkinter and Pygame libraries. It allows users to play, pause, stop, and navigate through a list of songs.

## Features

- Play music: Allows you to start playing the selected song.
- Pause music: Pauses the currently playing song.
- Continue music: Resumes the paused music.
- Stop music: Stops the currently playing song and resets the player.
- Next and Previous buttons: Navigate through the playlist to play the next or previous song.
- Song Selection: Displays the chosen song.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3**: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
- **Tkinter**: The Tkinter library is used for the GUI and comes pre-installed with Python.
- **PIL (Pillow)**: This is used to handle images and requires installation (`pip install pillow`).
- **Pygame**: Used for music playback. Install it using `pip install pygame`.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the Python script in an environment with the necessary libraries installed.
2. **Interface**: The application will display a window with a list of songs available.
3. **Select a Song**: Click on a song in the list to select it.
4. **Control Buttons**: Use the control buttons (play, pause, stop, next, previous) to manage the music playback.

## Notes

- Ensure your songs are located in the specified directory `C:\songs`. You might need to modify the path in the code to match your song directory.
- The images used for buttons are loaded from the 'icons' directory. Ensure these images are available or replace them with your preferred icons.

## Important Information

- The code might require modifications based on your system configuration and file paths for music and images.
- To stop the application, close the window or utilize an exit mechanism within the code.
